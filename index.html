			<h2>Project Discriptions</h2>

				<h3>Occupational Issues in Minnesota</h3>

					<p>This website was created as part of my Web Design Principals Course during my first year at MCAD. This was a design based final assignment that required us to create a website featuring some issue in our community. I chose to focus on occupational issues in Minnesota. In addition to the HTML and CSS I have included Responsive Design on the webpages.</p>

				<h3>Camp Acorn</h3>
				
					<P>This website was initially created as partof my web development course  during my first year at MCAD. This was part of a final project where we were assigned to create a three page website featuring our HTML and CSS skills. I decided to create a fictional kids sports summer camp theme for my website. The website includes images, general information about the camp, activities and sports offered. Later I added Javascript and Responsive Design to the webpages.</P>

				<h3>Como Park Friends</h3>
				
					<p>This website was created for my Responsive Design course at MCAD. This course and this project had both a web design and development focus. This assignment was to find a website online and redesign three pages of the website. I choose the Como Park and Conservatiory website. When creating these pages I incuded design elements, HTML, CSS, SCSS and Responsive Design.</p>

				<h3>Exploring the Wilderness</h3>	

					<p>This website was created as a semester long project for my Advanced Projects Studio course at MCAD. For this website I decided on a front-end web development focus. I created a website with a wilderness theme. The website consists of ten pages of information about climates, camping tips and survival skills. For this website I have included HTML, CSS, Javascript, PHP and Responsive Design.</p>
