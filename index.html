			<p>My  name is Molly Hennessy. I am a student at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design where I am a second year student in the Interactive Design and Marketing program. I have created this website to showcase my experience and skills. I have included several projects that I created during the course of my time at MCAD. The links to these projects can be found on the navigation menu  as well as on the sub-headings listed under projects. Below I have included a brief listing of the assisgnment goals and technologies used for each project. Additionally, I have included a webpage dedicated as an overview of the process of completing one of my projects, Exploring the Wilderness. This webpage can be found by clicking on the Wilderness Process link in the main navigation menu. After completing my studies at MCAD my career goals are to obtain employment in front-end web development or project management. I am especially interested in organizations that focus on accessibility, humanitarian causes and community development.</p>
