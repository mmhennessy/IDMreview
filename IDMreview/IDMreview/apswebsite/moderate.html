				<p>Moderate climates are divided into three categories: Mediterranean, humid sub-tropical and marine west coast. Mediterranean climates have warm to hot dry summers and mild rainy winters. They are found near the coast of continents and within 30 to 45 degrees of the Equator. Humid subtropical climates also have hot summers and mild winters. However, they differ from the Mediterranean climates because they have rain fall throughout the year. These climates are typically found in continental interiors or in the southeastern coastal areas between 25 and 40 degrees from the Equator. The final sub-group of climates in this group is called marine west coast. This sub-climate type is located on the west coast of continents where the weather is heavily influenced by the ocean and wind. The temperature is warm during the summer and mild during the winter with rainfall year-round. Moderate climates are found in the Southeastern and Western United States, Mediterranean Coast and other areas around the world.</p>
