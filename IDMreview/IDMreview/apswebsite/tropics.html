There are two types of tropical regions, wet and wet and dry. The wet tropical regions are generally hotter and more humid. They also receive more rainfall averaging between 70-100 inches of rain per year. The wet tropical areas are where the jungles are located which have rain year round. While the tropical wet and dry areas also known as tropical savannahs have wet and dry seasons during the year. Countries with tropical climates include Brazil and Indonesia.</p>
