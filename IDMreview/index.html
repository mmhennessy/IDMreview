			<p>My name is Molly Hennessy. As a student at the Minneapolis College of Art and Design, I have created this website to showcase my experience and skills,  including several projects created during my time at MCAD. The links to these projects can be found on the navigation menu as well as on the sub-headings listed under projects. Below is a brief listing of the assisgnment goals and technologies used for each project. Additionally, I have included a overview webpage dedicated to the process of completing one of my projects, Exploring the Wilderness. This webpage can be found by clicking on the Wilderness Process link in the main navigation menu. After completing my studies at MCAD my career goals are to obtain employment in front-end web development or project management. I am especially interested in organizations that focus on accessibility, humanitarian causes and community development.</p>
