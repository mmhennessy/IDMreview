				<p>TThere are three other climate types. The first is tundra. This is similar to subarctic in that there are short, cool summers and long, cold winters. There are two important distinctions. First the tundra is typically dry and also there is permafrost on the ground year-round. The tundra is located in places north of the Arctic Circle including northern Alaska. The second climate type is the ice cap. The ice cap is located in Antarctica and Greenland. The ice cap consists of below freezing temperatures year-round with little precipitation. The third category consists of highlands. The highlands are located in mountainous regions where the temperature and precipitation varies depending on location. </p>
