			<h2>Desert Climates</h2>

				<img src="images/Desert1.jpg">

				<p>The desert is very dry, receiving little to no rainfall throughout the year. Deserts or arid regions as they are sometimes called generally have hot simmers and mild to cold winters depending where they are located. There is so little water in these areas that only certain plants and animals can survive. Semi-arid or steppe as they are sometimes called are also deserts. However, they receive slightly more rain and have less extreme temperatures than arid regions. Examples of deserts include the Sahara and the Gobi. Many sub-arid regions are located next to deserts.</p>
