			<h2>Continental Climates</h2>

			<section class="photos">

				<p>There are two sub-groups under this category. This first is humid-continental. Humid-continental climates typically consist of mild to hot summers and cold winters, sometimes receiving heavy snowfall during the winter months. During the summer these areas can receive a significant amount of rain occasionally bringing severe storms. Minneapolis and Chicago have this climate type. The other sub-category is called subarctic. This climate type consists of short, cool summers and long, very cold winters. There is snow on the ground for much of the year. Most of Canada and Russia have this climate type.</p>
